Like 3gpp in wireless , theres should be some governing body to standardise the IOT interfaces 
If an OEM has to build an IoT device ,it should not be thinking of the interface protocol it has to choose out of n available otions , for ex. if the specific IoT device has to talk to phone over BLE/BT/wifi then the governing body should have fixed it earlier much to the convinience of the OEMs.
